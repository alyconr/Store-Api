# Product API Documentation

This is the l documentation for the Product API. The API allows you to retrieve product information with various filtering and sorting options. The API supports both a static endpoint that retrieves products with a specific name and a more flexible dynamic endpoint that allows you to filter, sort, and paginate the product data.
